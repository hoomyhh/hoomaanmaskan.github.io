Course Description
======

**Element 1 (6.5 hp): Theory**

In the course, continuous, discrete and stochastic signals, sampling and reconstruction, and discrete linear time-invariant systems (LTI systems) and their connection to convolution, are treated. Further, LTI systems given by difference equations, Fourier series and Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, z transform, frequency analysis of signals and discrete LTI systems, and digital filters, are included. Finally, multiresolution analysis and wavelets, and calculation of wavelet coefficients using filter banks are covered.

**Element 2 (1 hp) Computer labs**

Frequency analysis, effects of sampling, noise reduction and image compression using wavelets.
