I am a PhD student in Mathematical Statistics at Ume√• University (started August, 2020). Having a doctoral position funded by Wallenberg foundation/WASP (Wallenberg, AI Autonomous Systems and software Programming), I have been involved in many practical/theoretical projects during my graduate studies. To name a few, distributed programming, bayesian learning, language models, supervided learning, and reinforcement learning. My recent project, involves using [Probabilistic Circuits](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v115/peharz20a/peharz20a.pdf) (PCs) as generative models. Comming from a signal processing background, my theoretical research interests involve compressed sensing, sampling, inverse problems, accelerated methods in optimization, and difference of convex programming. Currently, I am exploring a subclass of difference of convex optimization algorithms to find connections with constrained optimization algorithms.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
