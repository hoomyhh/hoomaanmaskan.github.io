In the course, continuous, discrete and stochastic signals, sampling and reconstruction, and discrete linear time-invariant systems (LTI systems) and their connection 
to convolution, are treated. Further, LTI systems given by difference equations, Fourier series and Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, z transform, 
frequency analysis of signals and discrete LTI systems, and digital filters, are included. Finally, multiresolution analysis and wavelets, and calculation of wavelet
coefficients using filter banks are covered.
