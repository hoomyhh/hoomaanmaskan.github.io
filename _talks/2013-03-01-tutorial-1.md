In this talk, we consider unconstrained minimization of smooth convex functions. A variational perspective on high-resolution ODEs using forced Euler-Lagrange equation is proposed. Our study results in a faster convergence rate for gradient norm minimization using Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. We show that rate-matching discretization technique implicitly perturbs. Furthermore, we propose a stochastic method for noisy gradients.
