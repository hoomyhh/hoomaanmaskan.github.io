I am a PhD student in Mathematical Statistics at Umeå University (started August, 2020). Having a doctoral position funded by Wallenberg foundation/WASP (Wallenberg, AI Autonomous Systems and software Programming), I have been involved in many practical/theoretical projects during my graduate studies. To name a few, distributed programming, bayesian learning, language models, supervided learning, and reinforcement learning. My recent project, involves using [Probabilistic Circuits](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v115/peharz20a/peharz20a.pdf) (PCs) as generative models. Comming from a signal processing background, my theoretical research interests involve compressed sensing, sampling, inverse problems, accelerated methods in optimization, and difference of convex programming. Currently, I am exploring a subclass of difference of convex optimization algorithms to find connections with constrained optimization algorithms.

**[May, 2023]**  I started my recent project on [Probabilistic Circuits](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v115/peharz20a/peharz20a.pdf) (PCs). The aim is to use PCs as generative models which guarantee exact inference. Having priors generated from the PC, we leverage a Bayesian framework to recover noisy images.
